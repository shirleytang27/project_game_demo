Contents about the project:


This is a game demo created with Python programming language and an interface called PyQt5.

The file named 'main.py' is the main part for the frontend codes of the output interface, on which you could see introduction to the game.

The file 'character_game.py' presents the main part of the class 'characters', which was imported by the functions in file 'process_game.py'.

The file 'process_game.py' presents all the main actions and interactions the characters would take, from which the functions were imported by file 'main.py'.

The game consists of 10 heros that will form 2 groups, with team one (hero1-5) and team two (hero6-10). By running the 'main.py', you will first see the roles that are assigned to each group member randomly with the adjusted attributes. Then the members from two teams will attact each other, which could be seen by clicking on each hero profile. As the hero being attacked and the skill (with different damages) selected are random choices, so after each attack the one who is attacked loses different amount of blood. Once a hero dies, his profile changes to another picture. Once all members of a team are killed and game over.
